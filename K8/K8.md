# K8

**add arch image**

builds image create a new instance spins the same functionality to each of the pods 

```
kubectl get service
```

# Creating Pods of Nginx on Kubernetes

### Step 1.

Create a new folder to store the yml files we will be using.

### Step 2

Use the below command to open a file editor to create our nginx deploy script.

```
nano nginx-deploy
```

Paste the below script into this file.

```
---
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # pod

metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # look for this label to match with k8 service

  replicas: 3 # 3 pods
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # This label connect to the service

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: lewistowart/tech258-lewis-docker:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Step 3

We now want to create/run this deployment using the below command.

```
kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yml
```

You can use the below command to see the pods that have been created. As you can see within the script we have asked kubernetes to create 3.

```
kubectl get pods
```

You can also use the below commands to see the deployment stats of the pods.

```
kubectl get deploy
```
## Create a Service.yml

We now want to create a service to expose port 80 so that we can access our webserver.

### Step 1

Create a new yml file for the service.

```
nano nginx-service.yml
```

### Step 2

Paste in the below script file to expose port 80 to the public so that I can access my webserver.

```
---
# Select the type of api version and type of service/object
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
# Metadata for name
metadata:
  name: nginx-svc
  namespace: default # sre create spaces for backend or frontend
# Specification to include ports Selector to connect to deployment
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30001 # range is 30000 - 32768
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80


  selector:
    app: nginx

# Creating a nodeport type deployment
  type: NodePort # also use loadbalancer - for local use cluster IP
```

### Step 3

We now want to create/run this deployment using the below command.

```
kubectl create -f nginx-service.yml
```

You can use the below command to see the services that have been created.

```
kubectl get svc
```

## Create the App and associated Service

To deploy the app follow the same steps as above. The important differences to note is that we are now working with port 3000 and the name convention should be associated with the app and the app-service.

## Useful Commands

Can show the replication microservice as well.

```
kubectl get all
```

Delete a deployment

```
kubectl delete deploy nginx-deployment
```

Delete a Service

```
kubectl delete svc nginx-svc
```

## Code Explained

apiVersion: Specifies the API version to use for the Deployment resource (apps/v1 is the current stable version for Deployments).

kind: Declares the type of resource being defined, which in this case is a Deployment.

metadata: Provides metadata for the Deployment, including its name.

spec: Defines the desired state of the Deployment.

selector: Defines how to identify the pods managed by the Deployment using labels.

replicas: Specifies the number of pod replicas to maintain.

template: Provides the pod template used by the Deployment to create pods.

metadata: Sets the labels for the pods.

spec: Defines the containers that will run in each pod.

containers: Lists the containers to run in the pod.

name: Names the container.

image: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container.

ports: Lists the ports exposed by the container.

## Labels and Selectors

### Labels

Definition: Key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (like pods, services, nodes).

Purpose: Used to organise, categorise, and manage resources.

For example in my script the label is matching with the spec to create 3 nodes

### Selectors

Definition: Mechanisms to select a subset of Kubernetes objects based on labels.

Purpose: Used by controllers and services to identify and manage specific groups of resources.

For example in my code it is identifying any groups with the label app: nginx

## Deploying the Database

Follow the individual steps above using the below code for both the deployment yml and the service yml.

### Deployment Script

```
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # pod

metadata:
  name: database-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo # look for this label to match with k8 service

  replicas: 2 # 3 pods
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongo # This label connect to the service

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongo
        image: lewistowart/mongo-test:latest
        ports:
          - containerPort: 27017
```

### Service Script

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
# Metadata for name
metadata:
  name: database-svc
  namespace: default # sre create spaces for backend or frontend
# Specification to include ports Selector to connect to deployment
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30002 # range is 30000 - 32768
    port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017


  selector:
    app: mongo

# Creating a nodeport type deployment
  type: NodePort # also use loadbalancer - for local use cluster IP
```
